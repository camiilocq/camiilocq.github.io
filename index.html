                        My name is Juan Camilo Castillo and I'm 22 years old. 
                        I am an undergraduate student of systems engineering at Icesi University and I am currently
                        in my ninth semester. I am a young man passionate about dancing and 
                        during my professional training I also developed in the dances such as: Ballet, 
                        Salsa, Folklore and Latin dances. These performing arts allowed me to improve my social skills to a great extent,
                        since they were a continuous learning with people from different cultures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My greatest strength lies in my <Strong>high communication and leadership skills</Strong>.
                        which allows me to focus my skills to improve processes.<Strong>I am responsible, I am highly
                        adaptable to change</Strong> and thanks to the work opportunities I have had throughout my 
                        my career, I can make decisions under pressure. My training at Icesi, specifically in the branch of
                        systems studies, has trained me as a professional with <Strong>analytical and results-oriented</Strong>.
                        Which I have been able to apply in the projects in which I have participated.

                        I have been working with the Java language for 5 years.
                        This language is the one I have used the most throughout my career in different
